# Reporting for WinForms - How to Create a Federated Data Source at Runtime

A [FederationDataSource](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.DataAccess.DataFederation.FederationDataSource) is a data source component that integrates different data sources and provides uniform data access with a federated query.

The key part of this component is the [Queries](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.DataAccess.DataFederation.FederationDataSourceBase.Queries) collection that contains federated queries.
